Make a multi-band KiDS SourceList and convert to FITS:
1. run_kids_multicat.py which calls 2 and then 3.
2. make_associatelist_multicat.py. Can also be run independently of 1.
3. convert_kids_multicat.py
4. (optional) make_kids_pickle.py to convert FITS to pickle, which are 
smaller and load faster
